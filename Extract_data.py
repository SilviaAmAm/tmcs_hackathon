"""
This file should contain a function that takes as an input the data set folder and returns a numpy array containing the
xyz coordinates of all the molecules, a numpy array that contains the nuclear charge of each atom in each molecule and a
numpy array that contains the energy of each molecule. These should have the following dimensions/types:

xyz - numpy array of floats of shape (n_samples, n_atoms, 3)
Zs - numpy array of floats of shape (n_samples, n_atoms)
energies - numpy array of floats of shape (n_samples, 1)

where: n_samples is the number of data points in the data set and n_atoms is the number of atoms in a molecule.
