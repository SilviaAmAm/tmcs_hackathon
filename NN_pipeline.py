"""
This file should contain a data science pipeline that takes some data in (the Coulomb matrix) and fits an estimator to
the data. The estimator is scored and then used to make predictions on a test set which was not used for training.

The input data should have the following dimensions: (n_samples, n_features)

where: n_samples is the number of points in the data set and n_features is the number of features used to describe each
molecule.
