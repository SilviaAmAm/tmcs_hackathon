"""
This file should contain a function that takes as an input the plain coulomb matrix and calculates the sorted version of
it.

The inputs should have the following dimensions:
CM - numpy array of floats of shape (n_samples, n_atoms, n_atoms)

where: n_samples is the number of data points in the data set and n_atoms is the number of atoms in a molecule

The output should have the following dimensions:
sorted_CM - numpy array of floats of shape (n_samples, n_atoms, n_atoms)
